###### **_Theory_**
Defining the perspective by the viewing position (Point of View, POV)
One must keep in mind that photography is being replicated in the drawing, it is essential to define where one is standing, the viewing direction and lens being used, this knowledge applies to guessed perspective, constructred perspective, and even computer generated perspective, kowing these rules is vital for making things obvious when they are being broken. 

Defining the Point of View (POV)
The POV is comprised of the [[Ground_Plane]] upon which the viewer stands on top of, the eyes of the user is defined as the [[Station_Point]] with it's direction and incline defined as the [[Line_of_Sight]]. 

Going further, perpendicular to the [[Ground_Plane]] is the [[Picture_Plane]]. the [[Line_of_Sight]] passes through the Picture Plane, and the image that is imposed by the line of sight onto the picture plane is a constructed perspective drawing. the straight lines that pass through from eye to picture plane to object is what is called a [[Vision_Ray]].
