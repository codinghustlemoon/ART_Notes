###### **_Theory_**
The picture Plane is the surface on which images are recorded Imagine the picture plane being a late of gloss that is pinend perpendicular to the line of Sight.

It is time to capture the image, close one eye and on the glass, start drawing what you see behind the plate of glass, the [[Vision_Ray]] run from the eye to the object, passing through the picture plane. Record those transition points on the Picture plane and that is perspective drawing. 

Regarding the distance of the picture plane from the [[Station_Point]] it doesn't matter for the construction mentioned above. the Picture Plane at different distances just creates a larger drawing but the proportions in the drawing itself is identical.
