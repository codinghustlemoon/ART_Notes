###### **_Theory_**
The direction the viewer is looking at from the [[Station_Point]] is the line of sight.
The line of sight determines both the direction being looked at and the incline.

If the line of sight is parallel to the groud. This creates a 1 or 2 point perspective in which all physical vertical lines are represented by vertical lines in the drawing. 
Potential Example: Here

Tilting the line of sight (having the line of sight not parallel to the ground) creates a 3 point perspective, or even a 5 point perspective. for starters, it is recommended to keep the line of sight parallel to the ground, this makes the construction considerably easier.

###### **_Practice Guideline_**
When looking at references, or for example use a camera or google view, or some simulation, draw a ground plane to see and understand how it is constructed for different views.
