###### **_Theory_**
This skill is to improve your intuition in measuring a line without any measuring tools such as a ruler. In particular the skill practiced is focusing in divising a line by half. The reason for this is due to division by two is the most commonly used measurement while also being the simplest to learn. It is possible to learn to divide semi accurately in thirds, fifths or any nths, but the effort required to do it intuitively gets harder and harder.

The theory of dividing a line by intuition is simple, try dividing a line by half, either by eye, or try doing a ghosted line and divide your ghosted line motion (find the halfway point of motion). Afterwards compare it with an actual measured half (using a ruler or some other measuring tool)
A continuation of practice and confirmation can help gradually improve your sense of division by half (and also your sense of measurements of the line)

###### **_Classification_**
**Passive Skill** : it is passive as it is turning the skill into your intuition, enhancing your measurement or line length intuition.
**C+ Tier**: This skill while useful is not required to be able to draw, it is however a very good starting point at introducing your mind to measuring by intuition, which can greatly help with drawing lines with speed without losing accuracy.

put down various length straight lines and then put down by eye (intution) a mark of where the half line of a line is, then using a measuring tool compare it with the actual.
