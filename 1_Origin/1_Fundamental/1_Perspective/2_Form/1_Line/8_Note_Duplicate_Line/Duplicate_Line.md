###### **_Theory_**
The main point of this skill is to be able to measure and duplicate a line in a different angle by intuition. Take any straight line with various line lengths, and then replicate that line with a different angle. This skill while potentially not very applicable in various situations is a good way to start practicing your intution on consistency, being able rotate a line, and duplicate it somewhere else.

###### **_Classification_**
**Passive Skill** : It is intuitive use of consistent lines lengths, practicing your measuring and observation skill and the ability to replicate that.
**C Tier**: A very good point to practice a mix of your measurement intuition, ability to observe a line and manipulate it (in a different angle) and replicate the line with consistent length. however the actual skill of taking a line and replicating it with same length with a different angle is not a very common application.

###### **_Practice Guideline_**
1. draw a line and then attempt to draw a line with the same length with different angle (compare by using a measuring tool afterwards)
2. draw lines that go through a single point do that for various angles for the same point with different angles, now draw a circle around the end points of the lines, the resulting circle should be an accurate circle (or best as can be)
