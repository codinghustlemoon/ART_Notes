###### **_Theory_**
The theory for dotted lines is simple, it is taking straight or curved lines, and rather continuing in one smooth stroke always connected to the paper, you alternately pull your pen up and down in a repeating motion to have gaps in your line. This skill is useful for symbolizing a line to have different meaning compared to a smooth line, it is less visible making it useful for marking lines that might not usually be seen such as when drawing boxes in xray view. it is also useful for architectural design. 

Some points to keep in mind is that dotted lines can have various variables, you could use a rounded brush or calligraphy pen with sharp edges, or have long dots or short dots, or even circl dots. These give character to your dotted lines. However for keeping clean smoot dotted lines it is important to have repeating consistent dotted lines, this means each dot should be of similar sharpness and length. 

###### **_Classification_**
**Active Skill** : Dotted lines is active as all it does is augment your straight and curved linework to get a certain effect.  It does not directly enhance your linework.
**C Tier**: A useful and fun linework skill, usable in various situations, however it is also limited in it's style.
