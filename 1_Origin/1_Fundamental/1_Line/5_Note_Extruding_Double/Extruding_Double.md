###### **_Theory_**
This skill is to improve your intuition in measuring a line without any measuring tools such as a ruler. In particular the skill practiced is focusing in extruding a line by double. 

The theory of doubling a line by intuition is simple, try extruding a line by half, either by eye, or try doing a ghosted line and divide your ghosted line motion (find the halfway point of motion). Afterwards compare it with an actual measured half (using a ruler or some other measuring tool)
A continuation of practice and confirmation can help gradually improve your sense of division by half (and also your sense of measurements of the line)

###### **_Classification_**
**Passive Skill** : it is passive as it is turning the skill into your intuition, enhancing your measurement or line length intuition.
**C- Tier**: This skill while useful is not required to be able to draw, it is much less useful then division by half as well as extruding a line is not a common workflow when creating lines.

An exercise you can try is star with a straight line and next to that line try to extend the first line by double, and then try again with the new line. (The red above is by directly comparing with a ruler, and the blue is re measuring by eye to try seeing if the original attempt was close without a ruler as ruler's can get tedious)
